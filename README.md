This project was made with the goal to provide a platform that aims to fix issues with existing solutions like Discord, TeamSpeak, Revolt, Fosscord, Matrix, TeaSpeak and all others out there and to create new, advanced and easy to use features while creating as little friction as possible and keeping things intuitive.

## Why DCTS?

> [!NOTE]
> DCTS is still in development. Some features may not yet be fully refined.

Modern communication platforms have limitations and issues that DCTS is designed to overcome and fix. Here's why DCTS exists and how it stands out:

- **Full Data Control**: Self-host your server and take complete control of your data and privacy.

- **Easy to Set Up**: With just two commands (assuming Node.js is installed), you can have your server running.

- **Community-Driven**: Responsive development ensures your feedback and feature requests are heard.

- **Modern and User-Friendly**: Combines a sleek design with an intuitive interface for both casual and advanced users.

- **Highly Customizable**: The plugin system allows endless possibilities for enhancements and features, developed by the community or officially.

- **Efficient Media Handling**: Supports advanced features like a Cloudflare image CDN for fast and smooth media uploads.

- **No Paywalls**: Enjoy full functionality without subscriptions or hidden costs - DCTS is made for everyone.

- **User-Focused**: Designed to prioritize users, not corporations.

- **Future-Proof**: Built with scalability and future features in mind.

DCTS isn't just a chat platform, it's a vision for better communication, driven by simplicity, freedom, and innovation.
