# Enabling Server Listing

On default the server discovery feature is disabled. To enable it go to your `Server Settings` and click `Server Info`. You will see new settings there called `Enable Server Discovery?` and `Allowed Discovery Hosts`. 

To enable it, simply click the checkbox. Now the very important part: The allowed host list! Basically you would add the server list's url there and click `Add host`.
