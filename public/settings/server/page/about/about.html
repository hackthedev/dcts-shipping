        <h2 class="profile_headline">The Mission</h2>
       <p>
           I strongly believe that we will go back to self-hosting services and apps due to enshittification and other issues. We wont go
           back to self-hosting like back then where people run forums and things, no. This time its gonna have a twist: <b>decentralization</b>.
       </p>

        <p>
            While it may sound like a buzz word i believe its going to be the next generation of the internet, but the problem is that many
            existing solutions dont seem to make it right. Its often time too complicated to setup or to even get started for users, and i
            believe that this is the reason why it hasnt gone off really.

        <h2 class="profile_headline">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Decentralization isnt some complicated magic and is in fact fairly easy. DCTS has a seamless decentralized server list, and more decentralized
            features will be implemented. I in fact work on a library called dSync thats similar to socket.io's syntax to enable server-to-server based
            communication based on events. This enables me to make all sort of decentralized features and the best part is: the library is simple as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            I plan to make more apps that are about self hosting and making them decentralized if needed with dSync and i've made several prototypes
            testing dSync and how to seamlessly implement decentralized features without compromising the user experience.

        <h2 class="profile_headline">Too good to be true?</h2>
        <p>
            Im not sure if its considered easy. I think pulling something off like this requires quite some experience and very careful thinking and planing.
            In my case it only requires a lot of time and a handful of money so i can keep spending time on working on these projects, like DCTS.

            If you wanna help build the next generation of the web, please consider donating so i can keep working on it. Others have realised the potential and
            donated as well, but its not enough yet to work on my projects full-time.

        <h2 class="profile_headline">What about alternatives?</h2>
        <p>
            There are quite a few alternatives out there, like Matrix, Revolt (Sloat), Fosscord (Spacebar), Guilded, etc... but they all have their own issues. I
            think most issues are pretty "silly" but bad enough to kill the deal for me. Because of that i started the development of DCTS a few years ago.
