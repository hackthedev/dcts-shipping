# Enabling Server Listing

On default the server discovery feature is disabled. To enable it go to your `Server Settings` and click `Server Info`. You will see new settings there called `Enable Server Discovery?` and `Allowed Discovery Hosts`. 

To enable it, simply click the checkbox. Now the very important part: The allowed host list! Basically you would add the server list's url there and click `Add host`.

For example, the official server list is addressed at https://servers.network-z.com/, which means you would copy the url and paste there, followed by a click on `Add host`.

It is very important that you add the server list's address there, because otherwise the list service cant connect to your server!
